                        but I'm so proud of how strong you are and for continuing to push through
                        the adversities of life. You are such a blessing to me and I'm so luck to
                        have met a person like you.

                         you know just how much happiness you bring into my life. You're like a
                          ray of sunshine, filling my days with warmth and light, and for that, 
                          I am eternally grateful.
